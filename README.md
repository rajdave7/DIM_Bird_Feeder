# DIM_Bird_Feeder
an IoT project involving computer vison and machine learning to classify birds and dispensing respective food type according to the bird type.


This bird feeder is focused on dispensing the correct food for the respective type of the bird. With this, 
we're trying to contribute to the urban biodiversity preservation and protection. 


The project achieves this through pre trained model
to classify the birds and then use the Raspberry Pi 
to process the images and control the motors that are
responsible for the dispension of the food.
